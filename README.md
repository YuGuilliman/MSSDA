# AAAI 2025 "MSSDA: Multi-Sub-Source Domain Adaptation for Diabetic Foot Neuropathy Recognition"
Coming soon


## Statement
During the training and inference processes in view1.ipynb, we use a namelist that is sorted according to the real names of the patients, which is different from the fake sequence numbers provided by this repository. This results in a different sorting order for the namelist used in training. Therefore, your results will differ from those shown in view.ipynb.
